                    <p>Hello there!
                        My name is Nick Freberg. I'm a 21 year old college student in my senior year majoring in Computer Science at Bridgewater State University.
                        I'm from Abington, Massachusetts, born and raised, so Bridgewater isn't too far from my neck of the woods. I currently work on campus in the
                        IT department working in the ResNet department. I have been working here since the beginnning of my junior year and I can safely say that it 
                        has done wonders in terms of jumpstarting my career in the computer science field. I have grown into probably the most tech savvy member on 
                        the team, having worked very closely with the Networking team. In fact, during January of 2019, I helped assist in BSU's Network Infrastructure
                         upgrade by installing and configuring brand new Cisco Catalyst switches in each of the residence hall telecommm closets across campus.

                             When I graduate, I hope to join the BSU IT department as a full time staff member. I have become well acquainted with my colleagues and 
                             the campus community to a point where this place feels like home.

                    <p>Whenever I'm not working, I like to pass the time by playing video games, building computers (or at least think about it. Those things are expensive!!), 
                        and watch/play sports. I play lots of PC games. I've put hundreds of hours into Rocket League and from time to time dabble into horror games such as 
                        Dead by Daylight with my friends. Recently, I have started streaming on Twitch under the username TechNickality_Gaming. Clever name, I know.
                         As for sports, I'm a basketball and football kind of guy.
